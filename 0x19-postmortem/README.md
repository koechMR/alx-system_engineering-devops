Issue Summary
On Sunday, November 12, 2023, at 08:30 EAT (East Africa Time), a critical outage occurred on our web stack debugging platform, affecting approximately 30% of users. The outage lasted for two hours and ten minutes, ending at 10:40 EAT. During this period, users experienced delays in log processing and reduced functionality, resulting in frustration and hindering their ability to effectively debug their web applications.
Timeline
08:30 EAT: User complaints start to pour in, indicating slow response times and system unresponsiveness.
08:40 EAT: DevOps engineers receive alerts from the monitoring system, signaling performance issues in the backend services.
08:45 EAT: Investigation begins, focusing on the backend services, database, and network infrastructure to identify potential causes.
09:00 EAT: Initial assumption points towards a database bottleneck due to increased load.
09:30 EAT: Further analysis reveals normal database performance, ruling out the initial assumption.
10:00 EAT: Incident escalates to the senior engineering team for a more thorough investigation.
10:20 EAT: Root cause identified: Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to uneven traffic distribution among backend servers.
10:30 EAT: Load balancer configuration corrected, restoring normal traffic distribution and resolving the outage.
10:40 EAT: System functionality fully restored, and incident declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the outage was an incorrect configuration in the load balancer settings. The misconfiguration resulted in an uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers, causing some servers to become overloaded and unresponsive. This led to the observed delays and reduced functionality for users attempting to access the debugging platform.
To resolve the issue, the load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure equal traffic distribution across all backend servers. This effectively eliminated the bottleneck and restored normal system functionality.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
Enhanced monitoring: Implement more comprehensive monitoring tools to detect load balancer misconfigurations promptly.
Improved testing and deployment: Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure load balancer configurations are validated during deployments.
Documentation review: Review and update documentation to include load balancer best practices and troubleshooting guidelines.
Regular audits: Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential issues.
By implementing these measures, we can significantly reduce the risk of future outages and ensure the stability and performance of our web stack debugging platform.
